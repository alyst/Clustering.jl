    "text": "DBSCAN\'s definition of a cluster is based on the concept of density reachability: a point q is said to be directly density reachable by another point p if the distance between them is below a specified threshold epsilon and p is surrounded by sufficiently many points. Then, q is considered to be density reachable by p if there exists a sequence p_1 p_2 ldots p_n such that p_1 = p and p_i+1 is directly density reachable from p_i.A cluster, which is a subset of the given set of points, satisfies two properties:All points within the cluster are mutually density-connected, meaning that for any two distinct points p and q in a cluster, there exists a point o sucht that both p and q are density reachable from o.\nIf a point is density-connected to any point of a cluster, it is also part of that cluster."
